The simulation script is written for NS-2.34 with tcl8.4.\r\n2. `cd` to the folder by terminal\r\n3. run `ns zigbee.tcl`. This will generate the simulation results stored in the output file named \"zigbee.tr\".\r\n4. run `awk -f thr_drop_delay.awk zigbee.tr` to get the performance results.\r\n5. run `gnuplot` and `plot xxx.dat` to get the figures of simulation results.\r\n\r\n### Some Results\r\n![Throughput](https://raw.github.com/yongsen/ns2_zigbee/master/out/throughput_02_05_1.png)\r\n\r\n![Throughput with beacon (dis)enabled](https://raw.github.com/yongsen/ns2_zigbee/master/out/thr_beacon.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
